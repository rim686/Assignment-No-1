Seven billions people are on this earth,and everybody is different from the rest of others.There is nothing without purpose in this world.Everything has some purpose.<br/>
Human are the best creations,and each person is exclusive.Thus,writing about myself,i'm here to express myself that what i see,what i experience and what i plan for my life.<br/>
I try myself to be modest,passionate,devoted,hardworking and honest.I am Rimsha Naseer.Just as every human being is a model in his own personality,so am i.<br/>
My age is 20 years and i was born on 14th of february 2002,in Alipur.Basically,i am from Azad Kashmir but right now i am living in Alipur,Islamabad.<br/>
Nobody comes in this world,without the support of family and friends.Actually,whatever you will be,it is just because of your family.<br/>
My father is known as Muhammad Naseer and i am his third daughter.I have grown up with my two elder sisters who never let me feel that i have no brother.My father is a doctor.<br/>
My father always believes me and show a sense of confidence in me.My mother is also doctor but now she is house wife.she is very sweet,she takes care of everyone in our family.<br/>
There are a lot of things i like and i don't like.My hobbies include reading novels,some informative books,cooking and sometimes baking in my leisure time.<br/>
At my pre-childhood,i used to listen to stories from my grandmother,and this has a long-lasting effect on me.I love to travel and wished to have a dream tour to Turkey.<br/>
The things which i don't like includes bullshiting or to disrespect someone.I have done my matriculation from Islamabad model college for girls punjgran FA Islamabad.<br/>
I have done intermediate from Army public school & college pothwar complex,Alipur frash Islamabad.Currently,i am doing bachelor's in computer science from FUUAST Islamabad.<br/>
My aim is to become a graphic designer.I have a long term dreams related to my future and i am also working for it.Throughout the years i have had some obstacles and some of them i still have.<br/>
But life is a combination of both happiness and hurdles.Well by now you might know some of my personality but i am going to tell you some more.<br/>
I think some more good points about my personality are that i love to have gatherings with my friends.I don't have a big circle of friends but i have some but loyal friends.<br/>
In other words,i don't prefer quantity but quality of anything.Also,a bad thing about me is that i don't bare anyone's rudeness or misbehaviour with me.<br/>
If anyone does that i let them go and never talk to them again untill they realize their mistake.The advise of my parents had a keen effect on my habbits.<br/>
I believe to speak the truth and try my best not to lie.My parents always advised me that if i commit a mistake,i should admit it.I try my best to do so.<br/>
These are all things which express me.Though nobody can be described in a few sets of sentences.One needs to have yet command of oneself before going to write something about his life.<br/>
Life is meant to be lived avidly and visualization to do good for your fellow beings.Keeping this aim in mind,i have always desired to serve my people in whatever capacity i can.
